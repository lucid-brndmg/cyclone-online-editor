</code></pre>
<p>If it is set to true (<code>option-trace=true;</code>), Cyclone will produce a trace file that contains concrete values of each variable in each state/node of the path discovered. If there is no model, no trace file will be generated. By default, this option is disabled (<code>false</code>). The trace of a specification file is stored in directory named trace that normally is under your current directory.</p>
