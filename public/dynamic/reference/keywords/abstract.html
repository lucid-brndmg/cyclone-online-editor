<p>abstract is a modifier in Cyclone.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>The keyword abstract is used to declare a node. A node with abstract modifier indicates that this node does not contain information such as variable declarations and expressions. The compiler treats an abstract node as a pure node (does not contain any other information) in a graph, ignores all the expressions enclosed between { and }.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone"> abstract node  S0 { 
      int s0_counter=0;//ignored by the compiler
      global_counter++;//ignored by the compiler
 } 
</code></pre>
<p>By default, a node in Cyclone specification is abstract. If you wish to use variables and expressions within a node, then a node must be declared with <a href="https://classicwuhao.github.io/cyclone_tutorial/expr/normal-key.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">normal</a> modifier.</p>
