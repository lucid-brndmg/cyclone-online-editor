```cyclone
bool option-debug;
```

If it is set to true (`option-debug=true;`), Cyclone will enter into debug mode, output internal data structures and values for debugging purpose. By default, this option is disabled (`false`). The debug information is stored in directory named debug that normally is under your current directory.
