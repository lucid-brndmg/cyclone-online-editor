<h4>DFA Exercise 3</h4>
<p>Find all strings such that every string has a length of 6 and <strong>does not end</strong> with a substring abb. You can assume Î£ here is: {a,b}. Hint: you need to draw a DFA first,then use Cyclone to find all strings.</p>
<h4>De-icing Taxiways</h4>
<p>During the winter seasons, many major international airports need a service of de-icing their taxiways connecting multiple terminals. Each taxiway has its own direction sign. No airplanes can take off or land during the de-icing process. Typically, de-icing takes sometime to complete and can be very expensive. Hence, many international airports always seek an optimal way of faster de-icing and keeping their cost low at same time.</p>
<p>To find an optimal solution, an airport must compute a route for its <strong>deicer</strong> (a de-icing vehicle) to deice every taxiway. It is quite obvious that the best solution is to <strong>deice every taxiway exactly once (based on its direction sign)</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the following graph shows a basic layout of a major international airport. Terminal A,B,C,D are passenger terminals. E and F are cargo terminals. The main taxiways are marked as edges in the graph. Each taxiway has its own direction sign. For example, an airplane can move from <strong>Terminal D to B</strong> through taxiway <strong>t1</strong> (but cannot move from B to D). This also applies to a deicer.</p>
<p>Now use Cyclone to help this airport to compute a route for its deicer such that every taxiway gets deiced exactly once.</p>
