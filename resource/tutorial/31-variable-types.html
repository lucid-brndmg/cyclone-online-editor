<h1>Chapter 3: Understanding Cyclone</h1>
<p>In this Chapter, we will explain some of the Cyclone language features in detail. This may help you to understand Cyclone better for building your models.</p>
<h3>3.1 Variable Types</h3>
<p>The value of a variable in Cyclone can be <strong>changed</strong> from state to state. In the current version of Cyclone, there are five types of variable a user can use.</p>
<ul>
<li>int</li>
<li>real</li>
<li>bool</li>
<li>enum</li>
<li>record</li>
</ul>
<h4>Integer</h4>
<p>An integer type variable is declared using keyword int. The range of an integer is the same as the those integers in a general purpose programming language such as Java and C++. That is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. For example, the following piece of code creates an integer type variable called <strong>x</strong>, and this x is initialized with value of 0.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone">   int x=0;
</code></pre>
<h4>Real</h4>
<p>A real type variable is declared using keyword real. The range of a real number is from about 3.40282347x1038 to 1.40239846x10-45. For example, the following piece of code simply creates a real number of <strong>x</strong>,</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone">   real x=-2.32;
</code></pre>
<p>When Cyclone produces a trace that has real numbers, by default two digits after a decimal point are preserved. However, one can set a different precision through an option. For example, the following option tells the compiler to preserve 4 digits (after a decimal point) during trace generation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone">   option-precision=4;
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, Cyclone can preserve 1-6 digits after a decimal point for a real number.</p>
<h4>Bool</h4>
<p>A bool type variable is declared using keyword bool. Only boolean-typed values (<strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>) can be assigned to a bool type variable. For example, the following initialization of a boolean variable is illegal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone">   bool b=x+3; //illegal
</code></pre>
<h4>Enum</h4>
<p>An enum type variable is used for a set of predefined constants. This is done through using enum. An enum variable must be equal to one of the predefined constants. You can use a # to assign an enum variable to one of its predefined constants. For example, the following piece of code assigns a constant <strong>ON</strong> to the variable switch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone">   enum {ON, OFF} switch=#ON;
</code></pre>
<h4>Constant</h4>
<p>A constant in Cyclone is very much the same as constants in other programming languages. That is once a constant is defined its value <strong>cannot</strong> be changed from state to state. To declare a constant data type, one can use the keyword constant. For example, the following code declares 3 different kinds of constants.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone"> const int A = 3;
 const real PI = 3.1415926;
 const bool B = true;
</code></pre>
<p>An enum type is a special constant. Thus, it cannot be declared using the keyword constant.</p>
<h4>Record</h4>
<p>A record type in Cyclone is a complex data type. It allows users to use a mix of different data field in a single data type. Currently, a user can declare the integer, real, bool and enum data fields within a record. For example, the following record creates a point that contains two integer fields:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone"> record point {
     int x;
     int y;
   };
</code></pre>
<p>We use a dot operator (.) to access its field just like other programming languages. Thus, the following code assigns a 0 to the field x in point.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone"> point.x = 0;
</code></pre>
<p>Each data field declared inside a record type can be associated with a where clause. A field is associated with a where clause is a conditional field (variable). See below.</p>
<h4>Conditional Variables</h4>
<p>In Cyclone, users can use a special type of variable called conditional variable to build their models. So what is a conditional variable ?</p>
<p>In short, a conditional variable is a variable that is attached to a boolean condition. During computation, a conditional variable must meet the attached condition. Conditional variables are quite useful for limiting the range of a variable. To create a conditional variable, users can create a normal variable first and then use a <a href="https://classicwuhao.github.io/cyclone_tutorial/expr/where.html">where</a> clause to specify a condition. For example, the following piece of code creates a conditional variable <strong>x</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone"> int x = 1 where x &#x3C;= 0 &#x26;&#x26; x >= 3;
</code></pre>
<p>This variable x is a conditional variable. It is initialized with a value of 1 and attached to a condition: it must stay between 0 and 3 during the computation.</p>
<p>There are some rules when creating a conditional variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://classicwuhao.github.io/cyclone_tutorial/expr/where.html">where</a> clause can only specify a boolean condition.</li>
<li><a href="https://classicwuhao.github.io/cyclone_tutorial/expr/where.html">where</a> clause cannot be used for a constant including enum data type.</li>
<li>The condition described by the <a href="https://classicwuhao.github.io/cyclone_tutorial/expr/where.html">where</a> clause cannot use other variables except for itself or a constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following conditional variables are illegal in Cyclone.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone"> int x where x = x+1; //not a boolean condition
 int y where y > x;//refer to another variable x
 const int z where z > 2;//z is a constant
</code></pre>
<p>Semantically speaking, the condition specified by a conditional variable must hold in any computation. This includes each computation in every node/state including initial node/state.</p>
<p>The following piece of code shows a valid conditional variable in use of computing an area of a circle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cyclone"> const real PI=3.14159;
 const int MAX=15;
 const int MIN=7;
 int r where r >= MIN &#x26;&#x26; r &#x3C;= MAX;
 real area = PI * r * r;
</code></pre>
<p>During any computation, the variable <strong>r</strong> must stay between 7 and 15.</p>
<h4>3.1.7 Fresh Variables</h4>
<p>To keep the design of Cyclone simple, all variables declared in Cyclone are visible to every node/state. Thus, every node/state can use a variable for its own computation. However, sometime we would like to use a variable that does not depend on other states. In other words, this variable is state independent. A user can use fresh variables for state independent variables.</p>
