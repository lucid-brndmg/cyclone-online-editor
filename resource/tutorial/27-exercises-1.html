<h3>2.7 Exercises (1)</h3>
<h4>Second Solution</h4>
<p>Use Cyclone to find the second solution to <a href="/tutorial/23-defuse-a-bomb">the defuse bomb problem</a>. Hint: you need to use path conditions to eliminate non-meaningful actions such as Fill Jug1 -> Empty Jug1 -> Fill Jug1.</p>
<h4>Verifying Programs</h4>
<p>Use Cyclone to prove the validity of the following programs (don't forget you need to specify a loop invariant). In all programs below, the variables type are integers.</p>
<pre><code>// Program 1
    [x >=0]
    a = x;
    y = 0;
    while (a!=0){
        y = y + 1;
        a = a - 1;
    }
    [x = y]
</code></pre>
<p>The precondition here is <strong>x>=0</strong> and postcondition here is <strong>x=y</strong></p>
<pre><code>// Program 2
    [y=y0 ∧ y >=0]
    z = 0;
    while (y!=0){
        z = z + x;
        y = y - 1;
    }
    [z = x * y0]
</code></pre>
<p>The precondition here is <strong>y=y0</strong> ∧ y >=0; and postcondition here is <strong>z = x * y0</strong></p>
<pre><code>// Program 3
    [x>=0]
    y = 0;
    while (y!=x){
        y = y + 1;
    }
    [x = y]
</code></pre>
<p>The precondition here is <strong>x>=0</strong> and postcondition here is <strong>x = y</strong></p>
